# hombrew-NMAAHCmm
A brew formula to install the scripts from the nmaahc/nmaahcmm repository.

## How to Install
There are two ways to tap these formulas in terminal:
1. Run `brew tap nmaahc/nmaahcmm` and then run `brew install nmaahcmm`
2. Or run `brew install nmaahc/nmaahcmm/nmaahcmm`

### Note
This is to install version 5. If you ran into an error fetch the directory failed, homebrew is installing the order version, in which case, run `brew update-reset` to reset your tap to the most recent version.
